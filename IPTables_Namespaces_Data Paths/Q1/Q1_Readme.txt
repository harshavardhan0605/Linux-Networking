This Readme includes details about the question1 with respect to the Libvirt+Python

-> List all Mac and IP addresses:  (hw3-q1-1.py)
For this you would have to install Qemu Guest-Agent which will help the qemu driver to get 
IP address.

-> Resolving MAC address and IP address (hw3-q2-1.py)
This code will be executing on the local machine 
For resolving MAC addresses we are using mini-do library to parse the qemu vm xml file
and change the conflicting MAC addresses to some random MAC generated by random generator.
We have also taken care that this random MAC address also doesn't conflict with any pre-existing MAC addresses. 

For resolving IP addresses we are shutting down the machine if we find a IP conflict, and restarting it because when a machine is restarted the VM automatically looses it's IP so that it can be assigned a new un-conflicting IP address by dhclient.
We have kept the sleeping time after shutdown for 15secs to give it enough time for the machine to completely shutdown. 
Also make sure here that in order for the IP conflict to work perfectly all the VM's should be installed with guest agent as specified in previous question. 

-> Extend your application: (hw3-q3-1.py)
The list of hypervisors for which the conflict has to be resolved is given as command line arguments separated by spaces. 
The command line argument for a single hypervisor needs to be in the format of:
username@ip_address Example: ece792@192.168.124.5

Example to run command on multiple hypervisors: 
python hw3-q3-1.py ece792@192.168.124.5 ece792@192.168.124.10
Now the above command will run on both the hypervisors as specified and the user will be prompted for the password when the python libvirt is attempting to ssh to those VM's.
Also we assumed that we are resolving conflicts of VM's across all hypervisors.
